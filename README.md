# MzAdan (v.1.1)

MzAdan is a cross-platform (Windows, Mac Os, Linux) Java desktop application for the annotation of high resolution full scan mass spectra acquired in positive or negative mode and currently focused one singly charged adduct ions. 

## Description 

Observation of adducts and neutral losses is quite common in electrospray ionisation (ESI) and can be used for the identification of protonated molecules, which can then be assigned as precursor ions for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The focus of the mzAdan software is to automatically annotate [M+H]+ candidates with the help of a customizable set of annotations. It assumes that any ion in the mass spectrum is an hypothetical [M+H]+ regardless of its intensity. The current version of mzAdan works on singly charged ions but will evnetually be extended to multiply charged ions. The software can process a single spectrum or multiple spectra in the mgf format. 

## Prerequisite and Usage

Before launching mzAdan for the first time, make sure that you have installed a recent release of the Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher) and downloaded the most recent distribution of the software.

To launch the application, on Mac OS simply double-click on the mzAdan.jar file or double click on the mzAdan.bat file, if you are using Windows.

## Content 

### Resources Archive

The resources archive includes three folders:

1. **Data Folder**

Contains a dataset in the form of a MGF file and consisting of five LC-MS full scan mass spectra of five different metabolites. This dataset is intended to be used for the tutorial.

***Table 1**: Compounds included in the mzadan_mix_5.mgf dataset.*

| index	| rt (min) |            name          | exact mass (u)| 
|:-----:|:--------:|:------------------------:|:-------------:|			
|   1	  |   1.564	 |    N-Acetylputrescine  	|   130.11121   | 
|   2	  |   4.578  |   Ethenodeoxyadenosine  	|   275.10335   | 
|   3  	|   7.57	 | Monomethyl glutaric acid	|   146.05793   | 
|   4	  |  10.363  | N-Acetyl-L-phenylalanine	|   207.09041   | 
|   5  	|  17.359	 |     Taurocholic acid	    |   515.29167   |

2. **Output Folder**

Contains the annotations tables, candidates tables and the graph files generated by the software as the result of processing the above-mentionned dataset (***Table 1***).

3. **Annotation Folder**

Contains three custom annotations tables specifically formatted to be imported into mzAdan.
